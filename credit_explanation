The pricing discrepancy observed in the redemption leg arises from the choice of interpolation methodology used to construct the survival curve between CDS maturities. In the internal approach, continuous spot hazard rates are calibrated at the CDS maturities and linearly interpolated at intermediate points. Survival probabilities are then derived by applying

(t) denotes the interpolated spot hazard. This ensures exact agreement with market inputs at calibration maturities but imposes a smooth, linear evolution of spot hazards between them.

By contrast, the ISDA CDS Standard Model assumes piecewise-constant forward hazards within each coupon interval. Survival therefore decays exponentially within each period and exhibits discontinuous changes in slope at coupon boundaries. Both approaches are consistent at the CDS maturities themselves, but between pillars the implied survival probabilities differ. When forward hazards are upward-sloping, linear spot interpolation tends to understate cumulative hazard and produce higher survival values; the reverse holds for downward-sloping curves. These systematic but small differences explain why the redemption leg valuation under the internal method does not exactly replicate the ISDA standard.
