A further source of discrepancy between the internal valuation approach and the ISDA CDS Standard Model arises from the treatment of default timing within coupon periods. This difference affects not only the protection (default) leg, where it is most apparent, but also the premium leg through the recognition of accrued coupon upon default.

In the internal methodology, defaults are effectively recognised only at discrete coupon dates. Survival probabilities are applied at each payment date, and cashflows are adjusted accordingly. This simplification implies that, within each coupon interval, either the obligor survives the full period and pays the coupon, or defaults at the end of the period, in which case no premium accrual is recognised. While this approach is tractable and consistent with the spot-hazard interpolation used for survival, it does not fully capture the continuous nature of default risk within a coupon period.

The ISDA standard, by contrast, explicitly models default as a continuous-time event that may occur on any day. The hazard rate is assumed constant within each coupon interval, and both the protection leg and premium leg are evaluated by integrating over the entire period. In particular, if default occurs between two coupon dates, the premium leg includes accrued coupon up to the default time. This is handled in the ISDA framework through day-count conventions and closed-form integrals of the survival function, ensuring that expected accruals are included in the valuation.

The practical effect is that the ISDA approach produces slightly higher premium leg values compared to the discrete approach, since coupon accruals are partially preserved in scenarios where default occurs mid-period. Simultaneously, the default leg values differ because the ISDA method integrates protection payouts continuously rather than assuming that defaults occur only at discrete coupon boundaries. These differences offset each other to some degree, but they do not cancel exactly, leading to systematic pricing differences between the two methodologies.

In summary, the observed pricing discrepancy is attributable to the continuous vs. discrete treatment of default timing. The ISDA model incorporates day-level integration of defaults and associated coupon accruals, whereas the internal approach approximates default events at coupon dates. This divergence, while quantitatively small, introduces consistent valuation differences across both protection and premium legs.


The observed difference between the internally produced valuation and the benchmark ISDA valuation arises from the treatment of hazard rate interpolation and the associated construction of the survival curve. Both approaches are calibrated to the same set of CDS market quotes and therefore agree exactly at the quoted maturities. The divergence emerges only at intermediate maturities where interpolation is required.

In the internal methodology, continuous spot hazard rates are first calibrated at CDS maturities. For non-pillar dates, survival probabilities are then generated by linearly interpolating these spot hazards and applying the exponential mapping

By contrast, the ISDA CDS Standard Model constructs survival probabilities using piecewise-constant forward hazard rates over coupon intervals. In this framework, the forward hazard

This approach yields a survival curve that decays exponentially within each interval, with discontinuous changes in slope at coupon boundaries. The ISDA conventions also embed precise handling of day-count rules, accrual on default, and discounting standards, ensuring consistency across market participants.

The difference in interpolation conventions explains the discrepancy in the valuation of the redemption leg. When the forward hazard curve is upward-sloping, linear spot hazard interpolation tends to understate the cumulative hazard relative to the ISDA piecewise-constant specification, resulting in slightly higher survival probabilities and redemption leg values. Conversely, a downward-sloping curve would produce the opposite effect. Although these differences are quantitatively small—since both curves are anchored at the same CDS maturities—they are systematic and persist across instruments.

In summary, the internal approach generates a valid and internally consistent survival curve but does not replicate the ISDA methodology between CDS maturities. The pricing difference is therefore attributable to interpolation methodology, rather than to calibration error or implementation flaw.
